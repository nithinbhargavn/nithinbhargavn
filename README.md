Hi, I'm Nithin Bhargav, a passionate self-taught back-end developer and a software engineer from India. My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

I work mostly with Azure and Microsoft Stack.
